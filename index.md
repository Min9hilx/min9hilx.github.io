### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part 1 was one of my favorite labs to do since I learned so many new things from my partner. I really enjoyed coding the conversions and it really blew my mind how coding conversions work and how us coding this can make someone elesâ€™s life very easy.

* Lab 2 

Lab 2, part 1 was another one of my favorite labs since it was barely the 2nd week me and my partner got through the lab very well. Making sentences with plural,verbs, and nouns into them was really fun to do. It is crazy to think that you can make a computer do almost anything you want it to do. 

* Lab 6
 
Lab 6, part 1 was also very fun to do, making an ordering code for a sandwich was very fascinating to code. I also liked how we created an error message if the right inputs are not put in by the customer. This goes on to show us how these ordering platforms are made; it all starts from someone coding these functions out.
